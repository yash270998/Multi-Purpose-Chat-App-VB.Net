# Multi-Purpose-Chat-App-VB.Net

>This VB.Net app allows users to connect to different clients on the same network and talk to them by passing the
Ip Address and the port number. Along with this, the users can also share files to different clients by the same
protocol.

>Since this is a multi-purpose App, it has a text editor in built in this app with all the basic notepad functionalities.
It also includes a fun maze game with levels. Using keyboard presses of 'W-A-S-D', you play the game and as soon as it
hits a wall, the game resets.
